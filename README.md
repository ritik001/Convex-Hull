# Convex-Hull

Convex Hull repository includes implementation of graham scan and jarvis march.
The main part is to optimize the running time of algorithm by pruning the points.
It will prune the points by finding extreme points , so mainly prune and inside polygon
function is implemented.

To test provide N points (no. of points) followed by x and y co-ordinates 
of N points.
Also to test with large number of points , uncomment code to generate random points ;
It can be used to compare running time for both algorithm.
